# My Settings
I created the settings to use in Min Browser, adapted them so that they were perfect and also the user scripts that I use in my daily life.

*FullScreen*

It makes the screen full on all websites, the best example is on WhatsApp, which instead of being centered, it expands across the entire screen.

*Youtube with ads and shorts*

Removes all YouTube shorts and with it the ads too (I use it at min because the adblock itself is detected by YouTube).

*Low Cpu*

It causes the tab that is stopped to lock the images and gifs, making it use much less of the CPU, as if there wasn't even a tab open.
